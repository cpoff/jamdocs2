## Create event in Outlook Calendar

- Create a new event
- Select committee calendar (CAC, TMC, etc)
- Standard date, start/end times, reminder (optional)
- Add only internal attendees (e.g. committee chair) and no external attendees
- Reserve conference room, or select Virtual
- Go into Response Options, select Hide Attendee List and Allow forwarding. Leave Request Responses unchecked for virtual meetings and checked if we host the meeting at PAG. 
- Send

That creates your new meeting/event without making it visible to the public. At this point everything is still private.

Two things require approvals: the associated documents, and the meeting itself. 
- Sheila will deliver approved documents, which should be attached to the meeting in Outlook. Documents will require specific naming convention. (See below)
- The second approval (for the entire meeting) will also come from Sheila. Once the whole meeting is approved, go into the event in Outlook and add the <b style="color:green;">Green category</b>.

The sole purpose of the <b style="color:green;">Green</b> category is to indicate status, with <b style="color:green;">Green</b> being equivalent to LIVE. If it's <b style="color:green;">Green</b>, it's eligible to be viewed by the public. That's why the category should only be added once past the approvals threshold. Without the <b style="color:green;">Green</b> category it's not eligible and will not appear on the public PAG calendar. There shouldn't be any need to change the category once the docs & event are approved and set to <b style="color:green;">Green</b>.

Once approved you can also add <b>external attendees</b>. They will get a copy of the meeting invitation and all subsequent updates. Make sure you only add them at the end so that they're not getting spammed with all the minor updates to the event details.

You DO NOT need to worry about publishing at any particular time. The website has front-end logic that is looking specifically for items in the <b style="color:green;">Green</b> category that are no more than 7 days in the future.
