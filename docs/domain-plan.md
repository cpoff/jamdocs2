## PAG/RTA Host

Since we're running WordPress as multisite, we can have several sub-sites running on a single WP installation. So we'll create a single PAG/RTA Host as the 'network' parent, then put RTA, RTA Next, PAG, and any subsequent sites as children.

Plug-ins, themes, and other admin features are added at the network level and added/managed at the site level.

Multisite requires child sites be added as subdomain/subdirectories. So Jeff will build the domain structure and domain map for the redirects.
