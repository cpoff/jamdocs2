<h2>Our Role</h2>
The Regional Transportation Authority is an independent taxing district within Pima County. The RTA delivers multimodal transportation projects that improve our region's mobility, safety and environment. Pima County voters approved the 20-year RTA plan in 2006. To date, the RTA has invested over $1.2 billion generated by the RTA's half-cent excise tax within Pima County to improve your quality of life and support the region's economic vitality. </div>
